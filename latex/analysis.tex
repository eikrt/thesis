\chapter{Applying QuERIES} \label{analysis}

As mentioned in section \ref{queries}, the
QuERIES methodology is used for the analysis of this chapter. Table
\ref{pomdbtable} consists of all the possible states (S), defender
actions (D), attacker actions (A), and observations (O). Then, each
transition from one state to another state is calculated as a
probability. Carin et al. \cite{carin2008cybersecurity} use an economic model to estimate POMDP
parameters. We deviate from this 
methodology and calculate the parameters as transition probabilities
from each state for a given observation, as it provides a better
construction of attack graph and yields more specific data.

QuERIES as a model is described as multidisciplinary as it takes
inspiration from traditional red-blue team approaches and mathematical
models to economic models \cite{hughes2013quantitative}. In other
literature, particularly that of Bojanc and Jerman-Blažič \cite{jerman2008economic}, it is argued that
modeling cybersecurity with economic models can provide substance for
minimising risks organisation-wide. In this
chapter, we will apply the model and discuss its implications in both
security and economic standpoints. However, the main focus is on how we can improve the security of the architecture using QuERIES. 

\section{Modeling the problem and quantifying the models} \label{modprob}

The project example of this thesis is an image showing architecture
that could be used e.g. for advertisements, public transport timetables
or practically anywhere static media should be presented. If an
intruder gains unauthorised access, the results could range from
anywhere from displaying explicit imagery to succeeding in displaying
propaganda or other unwanted content. Unauthorised access would negatively impact 
service provider's economic standing, as every
organisation displaying media wants to remain credible among
stakeholders.

The attack surface of the example focuses on physical access
and vulnerabilities in remote connections. With MQTT-messaging, SSH
and display protocols, internal and external messaging takes place.

As mentioned in section \ref{queriesasmethodology}, the
value of intellectual property is capped at 1, for which other
parameters refer to as fractions of it. If this was applied to a real
setting, the value of intellectual property would be calculated
appropriately for the scenario.

\section{Modeling the possible attacks}

In this section, the possible attacks are modeled using an attack
graph, depicted as a POMDP which is a modeling tool presented
earlier. In the original paper where QuERIES is presented, the time to
reverse-engineer the system without prior information about the
protection sceme is an important parameter
\cite{carin2008cybersecurity}. Our approach is different; the attacks
are considered as successful, if they gain further leverage in the
attack graph e.g. transitioning from state ''idle'' to ''partial loss of
system''. This is to maintain cohesion in the study, for we don't need
to define what it means to ''reverse engineer'' the system. In our
case, the system configurations are publicly available as an open source
project, thus the information of the system being available also to
the attacker.

In table \ref{pomdbtable}, the first column describes states the
system can be in. The second and the third columns state defensive
actions and observations of the system. The fourth column contains a
template of the attacks that could be conducted. After forming the
attack graph depicted in the table, the attacker tries to breach the
system, leveraging through the A0-A4 column. The probabilities are
then calculated with the model presented in section \ref{queries}.

The algorithm produces a reward value for each QuERIES iteration,
which is used to improve the setup. For calculating reward values, R
script with library ''pomdp'' was used.

\end{landscape}

A weight of 1 was used for positive results and -100 was used if something
was to be compromised. This weight distribution is due to the fact
that even if blue team succeeds most of time, the effect of failure
is more drastic than a succeeding result. The
discount constant influences the priority of immediate
vs. future rewards \cite{mcabeeMarkov}. Our case signifies the
importance of both, so value of 0.75 was used. Note that the maximum
reward value is 4 and the minimum is -400.

\section{Using the results} \label{usingtheresults}

The reward score is taken in account on how
successful or unsuccessful the setup is from a security perspective. The
score itself is rather abstract; its main function is to demonstrate
the \textit{overall security} of the system. In short, negative
numbers imply that there are flaws in security and positive numbers mean,
that the system is more secure
\cite{mcabeeMarkov}.

As stated by Hughes et al. using the results means evaluating
the gained results to decide, if proposed protections are adequate for
our means \cite{hughes2013quantitative}. The QuERIES model was
iterated 2 times and the results were placed in the table \ref{iterationtable}.

\begin{table}[b!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
  \hline Iteration & Reward function & Proposed protections \\ \hline
  1 & -25 & Multiple \\ \hline 2 & 4 & None \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Protections applied in each POMDP iteration}
\label{iterationtable}
\end{table}

The reward function in the first iteration is calculated with the
mentioned script. The second value is calculated as the maximum
accumulated points; the highest value is 4 points without any
discount, as the red team failed to provide any results for the second
iteration. This is partially due to time limit, as there was only one
attacker with very limited time in the test setup. It can be argued,
that with more time, it would have been possible for the attacker to
breach.

As seen, the reward function is growing as the proposed protections
are applied in both iterations. In the figure \ref{timetobreach} we can see, that the time to breach peaks in the
first hour.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centerline{\includesvg[width=1.0\columnwidth]{../graph/barchart.svg}}
\caption[Probabilities to breach into the system.]{Probabilities to breach into the system.}
\label{timetobreach}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{timetobreach} has a similar
shape as the figure in the paper by Carin et al. \cite{carin2008cybersecurity} meaning that attacks
in their initial phase succeed more frequently. The figure \ref{openandclosed} is
used to decide, when is the optimal time to stop the attacks from the
attacker's perspective. We use this as well to reflect the cost estimate of
the blue team.

This economic model can be used to generalise risk in these kinds of
situations. In the graph \ref{openandclosed} we can see, that the cost
for the attacker peaks at about 6 hours using closed algorithm and at
3 hours using open algorithm. Open loop algorithm means, that the cost
estimate never evaluates feedback from a system
\cite{bars2006theory}. Closed loop behaves in an opposite manner; it
constantly modifies its behaviour based on the feedback it gets
\cite{bars2006theory}. In our case, the cost values using the open
algorithm remain unchanged, while with the closed algorithm, the value
decreases by 0.1 every hour.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centerline{\includesvg[width=1.0\columnwidth]{../graph/cost_graph.svg}}
\caption[Cost benefits of applied economic model.]{Cost benefits and reductions. The black dots indicate the
  most optimal times to stop the attack.}
\label{openandclosed}
\end{figure}

The blue team should be aware that in the first QuERIES iteration,
most of the breaches appeared in the first half of the time
segment. The blue team can use this information to estimate the future
distribution of breaches. In our case, the second iteration provided
no breaches, but it can be argued, that in different experimental
design, the attacker could have succeeded. The results do not mean that
the system is completely secure; instead we can use the first
iteration's estimates to decide on how could the blue team be improved
in the future. The blue team measures depicted in figure
\ref{pomdbtable} did not have the planned effect to protect the system.

We can see that with closed loop algorithm, the attacker can gain more
results with worse cost tradeoff, but with open loop, it gets
immediate results with a cheap cost. This could be important for the
holder of the intellectual property as it must protect itself against
attackers using both algorithms. In our case, where potential threats
include hacktivist groups, the cost estimate is less significant. What
matters more is the understanding that an attacker with no economic
interests could have virtually unlimited time to attempt a system
breach.

\subsection{Improving the system using Nix}\label{improvingwithnix}

The following measures were taken in the first iteration: disable USB
ports, change MQTT password to token based authentication and change
SSH to key based authentication. As we can see, the QuERIES output
provided concrete results on what are the weak points of the system.

As an example, the exposed USB-ports of the system were found to be a
problem due to the possibility of infecting the system. This can be mitigated easily by modifying the
client devices' configuration.nix with the following changes:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{lstlisting} 
{ config, pkgs, ... }: {
  boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_latest;
  boot.kernelParams = [
    "nousb"  # Disables USB at the kernel level
  ];
  boot.kernelModules = [];
  boot.extraModulePackages = [];
  services.udev.extraRules = ''
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", OPTIONS+="ignore_device"
  '';
}
\end{lstlisting}
\label{kernelsnippet}
\end{figure}

The configuration could be applied to any number of clients, proving
that Nix could be used to rapidly address arising security
issues. This supports the argument presented in chapter
\ref{imperative}, that through updatability the security could be
improved. This highlights the scalability of Nix systems; it does not
matter if we have one or thousands of devices – updating them is
equally simple. A huge contrast between imperative and declarative
systems is found, as imperative systems would need linear
administration time in relation with the number of devices in the worst case. The
configuration is only an example to mitigate hardware access attack
vectors, as there are many more ways for the attacker to leverage the
access, e.g. by replacing the whole device, depending on the resources
of the attacker.

\subsection{Issues with applied methodology} \label{issues}

One issue found using QuERIES with POMDP was that applying the reward
functions in our case is in rather arbitrary. We assumed, that for
positive results the reward function is defined as 1 and for the
negative outcomes as -100. This is due to the negative results deemed
as catastrophic and the positive results being slightly positive. The
choice for both parameters could have been any integer, but the issue
is, that it demands a ''gut-feeling'' of the author to select the
appropriate parameters. This is due to the deviation from the QuERIES,
where the POMDP parameters were not applied from the economic model. In our case, a trade-off to obtain
specificity forced us to rely on the set reward and discount
values. Using another model, for example the one presented by Wang
et al. \cite{wang2010framework} using hidden Markov models, would in retrospective provide us a
more specific layout of the attack graph, similar on how we applied
the QuERIES methodology. The
combination of both hidden Markov models and QuERIES could possibly be a ''best
of both worlds'' solution.

One remark using POMDP is that it produces very generalised
output. This is why we use methodologies such as QuERIES to improve
the system, POMDP being just one component. Other benefit from using
POMDP is that it provides us a concise attack graph and it can be argued, that
using the POMDP calculations may even be redundant. In POMDP, negative
rewards signify that the system has issues, and positive meaning that
the system is more secure \cite{mcabeeMarkov}. A more ergonomic approach
would be calculating rewards without positive outcomes, due to them
possibly shadowing the most critical issues.

\section{Generalising the results}

The results of this chapter could be generalised to a more complex
setting, using a similar methodology. The POMDP would scale well, if
more parameters were supplied. This study demonstrates that although
measuring cybersecurity is challenging, staying within strict
constraints allows for adequate estimates that can be used to apply
economic models for the red team, further analysing the risk vs. 
reward.
 
Carin et al. \cite{carin2008cybersecurity} argue that QuERIES can be
applied in both public and private sectors to help improve the
security of both the software and hardware. It can be argued that a hand-tailored
application of QuERIES can be used as a powerful model that is
ergonomic to use in the right hands. However, the use of complex
applied mathematics models requires proficency in both cybersecurity and
mathematics, which can be difficult to achieve in a real organisational
setting. This is why it is proposed in the next chapter, that a simpler, more pessimistic and more concise model would be easier to reach for an
organisation.
