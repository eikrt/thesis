\chapter{Embedded system security} \label{embedded}

In the previous chapter, the core differences between imperative and
declarative approaches were gone through. This chapter first discusses
the embedded security field in general, following up on how Nix can be
used to improve embedded security, reflecting the CIA-triad in section
\ref{nixosassolution}.

According to Serpanos et al. the use of embedded devices can be
divided into four fields: industrial systems, nomadic environments,
private spaces and public infrastructure
\cite{serpanos2013security}. This thesis' focus is public
infrastructure, specifically information screens in a public
environment. Implementing security mechanisms and policies is
essential for information screens to function securely from both
organizational and technical viewpoints. Implementing those policies
and assuring compliance is trivial with declarative approaches with
increased benefits from reliability perspective.

Embedded systems are distinct from other type of systems due to their
varying nature ranging from programmable logic controllers (PLC) to
larger systems, such as servers or
routers \cite{fysarakis2014embedded}. An usual embedded device
conducts a specific task and possibly demands networking
capabilities. Working with embedded is typically working with a
limited set of resources, demanding careful design when a multitude of
features are needed. Even services such as SSH have
had history of vulnerabilities, which prove that upgradability is a
fundamental base of a secure system
\cite{secopsolutionHistorySecOps}. It can be argued that the security aspect of
embedded devices could be improved significantly with the use of
declarative systems as seen in chapter \ref{imperative} section
\ref{declarativesystems} and in the section
\ref{nixosassolution}.

Embedded devices demand precision and security, as their function may
be very critical for variety of safety reasons, e.g in automotive
industry or healthcare applications \cite{turab2019secure,
  fysarakis2014embedded}. Reliability is a defining requirement for
number of embedded applications; a pacemaker that doesn't function all
the time reliably is completely useless. While a declarative solution
itself can't fulfill all security needs, it definitely could improve
the \textit{reliability} of such systems.

As stated by Fysarakis et al. implementing access control is essential
for any system to prevent unauthorized access
\cite{fysarakis2014embedded}. Defining complex access control is
trivial with Nix, as the configuration files denote completely which
user has accesses to which resources. Access control in a modern day
embedded environment could be hard to implement in traditional
imperative systems, as scaling such system that spans multiple devices
and changing environments would require a lot of manual
intervention. This is definitely one of strengths of declarative
approaches: scalability is never an issue when a centralized
configuration defines the systems. A declarative approach is often
adopted in the cloud, as discussed in chapter \ref{imperative}
section \ref{declarativesystems}, but its implementation still
requires significant effort in the embedded field.

Improving information security aspects using a policy
modeling standard, CIA-triad is discussed in section
\ref{imperativeanddeclarative}, and Nix is reflected with the use of
the triads axes. Dolstra states that Nix is policy-free meaning that
it contains a set of mechanisms which allow policies to be constructed
with and not the other way around \cite{dolstra2004nix}.

Embedded being a broad field, in this thesis devices are limited to
those which can run Linux kernel and provide the most basic networking
capabilities. These cover architectures i686, x86\_64, arm64 supported
by NixOS. PLCs and microcontrollers are outside of scope as NixOS
needs a functional Linux kernel and a specific architecture to work.

\section{Common embedded pitfalls}

Common issues regarding embedded devices are their lack of updates,
weak data integrity, and the multitude of features
\cite{kemmerer2003cybersecurity, fysarakis2014embedded}. For example,
a toy teddy bear may have a audio recorder, data transfer capabilities
and ability to geolocate itself. These kind of devices may lack
firmware or software updates, and the data-transfer may be insecure.

A solution for secure data transfer would be TLS-encrypted messaging
between clients. This could be achieved with MQTT-protocol, but
configuring certificates is extra effort. Multitude of features is a
definite security problem, as the user may not be aware of them at all
times. In an increasing global world, importing embedded devices from
unreliable sources can prove to be a security issue. The household
items may or may not adhere to latest security
compliance. \cite{fysarakis2014embedded}

Attack surface of embedded systems in general range from physical
access to network and geolocation problems. One way of manipulating a
device, apart from directly gaining access to the operating system,
are side channel attacks. Analyzing the power or electromagnetic
properties of device input/output can be used to determine critical
aspects of a device, e.g key lengths or algorithms of security
measures \cite{fysarakis2014embedded, serpanos2013security}. Attack
surface may used to gain access, or performing denial of service
attacks. Geolocating is both a privacy and security issue, as location
data may be used to trace identities of device users, which can lead
to e.g blackmailing, physical intrusion or other means
\cite{fysarakis2014embedded}. This means that the principals of this
thesis' reference architecture could theoretically be targeted with such malicious
intents.

Embedded systems have problems regarding monitoring and system
administration. It's very different to have home automation system
with less than 20 nodes, than to have public transport embedded fleet
in a big city with 2000 nodes. As the number of devices grow, so does
the challenge of monitoring and administrative tasks. Home automation
has usually one person dedicated to the task: the home owner. Monitoring should be trivial to automatize (e.g by using
tools like Prometheus), but administrative tasks are harder to
automatize, due to tasks being potentially very challenging even for
dedicated system administrators. This is where Nix comes to play, as
updating any number of devices becomes trivial.


\section{Nix as an embedded solution} \label{nixosassolution}

Declarative systems have advantages over imperative systems in
reliability and safety aspects due to two facts: rollout and rollback
are equally trivial tasks and desired configuration can be tested in a
sandbox environment. It's very accessible to manage a rollout strategy,
as the rollout/rollback can be done multiple times or executed
completely in a replicated sandbox environment. Simpler and more straight forward practical steps give space for
easier strategical planning \cite{kandoi2021operating}.

Kandoi et. al argue that with declarative systems, it should be nearly
impossible to misconfigure the system in the first place and if faulty
state was achieved, a simple rollback could undo the changes
\cite{kandoi2021operating}. As stated in chapter \ref{imperative}
section \ref{declarativesystems}, it's definitely possible to achieve
faulty systems with Nix. It can be argued that these problems can be mitigated
with a well thought rollout/rollback strategy with a dedicated test environment.

Updatability is possible with many different platforms, but it's a
problem when updating is a sole duty of a consumer, who may or may not
have the adequate knowledge how or why they should update their
systems. Lightweight updatability comes out-of-the-box with Nix, and
that is something that inherently should make it more secure. Consumer
products however are out of this thesis' scope.

Nix is a double edged sword for system administration tasks. On one
hand, it has a steep learning curve, but on the other hand it can make
tasks that could be very challenging with traditional systems
trivial. In a well built Nix ecosystem security actions such as
updating or modifying user or kernel space can be used to enhance
security and in such system, any changes could easily be replicated to
multiple devices, without the need for manual intervention.

Some other clear disadvantages for Nix in embedded use is the fact
that a purely functional, declarative system inherently must use disk
space more than it's imperative counterparts. In the worst case
scenario, if one derivation of a system takes up 1Gb of space, when
making changes, the resulting system will need 2Gbs of space \cite{dolstra2007purely}. The
worst case scenario rarely occurs, but due to Nix's indestructive
nature, this formula of disk space demands has to be considered in an
embedded setting. 

\section{Imperative and declarative systems from CIA-triad approach} \label{imperativeanddeclarative}

CIA-triad can be used as a tool to show conflicts between different
points of information security interests. It consists of three meters:
confidentiality, integrity and availability as seen in the figure
\ref{ciatriad}. Confidentiality can be seen as superset of
privacy. Confidential data is classified with technologies such as
data encryption and user privileges \cite{pender2019parkerian}. Integrity means that the data has
not been tampered with, and remains untouched by unauthorised parties
while it's in transit or stored e.g in a server \cite{pender2019parkerian}. A way of providing
integrity is checking hashes of downloaded files. Availability is a
user viewpoint to the accessibility of the system \cite{pender2019parkerian}. When
confidentiality and integrity are pushed to the extreme, availability
aspect suffers, e.g when a service enforces a strict multi-factor
authentication. 

Systems with an imperative package manager are more accessible than
declarative systems as learning a new programming language with
esoteric paradigm can pose extra effort. Configuring a whole Nix
system demands a thorough knowledge of Nix language, and that
definitely hinders the ease of access to a Nix system from a system
administrator standpoint. With NixOS, an easy extent of accessibility
can be achieved via planting sufficient configuration files during
device setup.

Atomic systems such as Nix have great benefits towards integrity. As
the Nix store, where every installation is located is read-only,
it's impossible for attackers to modify the store. That's not the
case in traditional approaches, where a user with root privileges can arbitrarily modify installed
programs and files.

\begin{figure}[t!]

  measures \cite{hughes2013quantitative}.}
\label{ciatriad}
\end{figure}

According to Nix manual, it has three main strengths in relation with
security. \textbf{Security by obscurity: }combined with the unusual
file system and the usage of user-environments, some malware that rely
on the usual locations of installed programs may fail
\cite{nixosSecurityNixOS}. This is a very thin layer of security, as
targeted malware has usually no problem navigating in an unfamiliar
environment. \textbf{Multi-user installations: }the requirement for
root access nearly always widen the potential attack surface. Nix
provides a way for multiple users installing their programs through
the use of user environments, hence mitigating the need for root
access. This both lessens the availability aspect, as well as
mitigates the programs root access. When file changes are made in
user-specific scope, a thin layer of isolation is achieved
\cite{nixosNixOSManual}. \textbf{Data integrity} is achieved both by
installed programs residing in the read-only Nix store, but also them
having been checked against SHA256 checksums. Moreover, the core
installation resources for NixOS are GPG-signed by an administrative
Nix team \cite{nixosSecurityNixOS}.

It's apparent that Nix can be used to improve embedded device security
with some hardware constraints. A purely functional declarative
solution can improve the rollout/rollback capabilities, testing
pipelines and provides features such as read-only Nix store. The next
chapter proposes an architecture solution which works as an example of
a Nix ecosystem. The main purpose of the architecture solutions is to
demonstrate the security implications of declarative systems which are then discussed 
in chapter \ref{analysis}.
