\chapter{Further research} \label{further}

One big limitation of Nix is the fact that it mainly supports only
x86\_64, i686 and arm64 platforms \cite{nixosNixOSManual}. This is not
generally enough, as many different architectures are used in
embedded, thus limiting the use-cases of
NixOS. \cite{fysarakis2014embedded}.

A declarative approach could be used with other processor
architectures. This would require work on a declarative package
manager, which would be used in conjunction with base systems created
with Buildroot or Yocto.

As far as security is concerned, the main methodology of this thesis'
research, QuERIES, proved to be an aqequate tool. It helped to improve
the security of the reference architecture. However, some issues were
raised in chapter \ref{analysis} section \ref{usingtheresults}
subsection \ref{issues}. These issues could be addressed in developing
a new methodology, inspired by QuERIES, providing explicit insight on
the weak points of the underlying system. This approach would be
similar to this thesis' QuERIES inspired methodology.

\section{Further research questions}


Questions for further research include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{What kind of new methodology would be more better, reflecting
    the found issues in QuERIES for similar use-case as in this
    thesis?}
  \item What set of tools would be optimal in creating a true
    cross-platform declarative package manager (e.g programming
    languages, possible configuration languages etc.)
      
    \item How could the new system handle common system security and
      administration problems better?
      
\end{enumerate}

These questions form ground for multiple separate studies.
